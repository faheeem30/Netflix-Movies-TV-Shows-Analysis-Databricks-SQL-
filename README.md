## üîπ Overview

This project analyzes the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset** available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows).

## üîç Analysis Performed

Using SQL queries, the following analyses were performed on the dataset:

1. **Movies vs TV Shows**

   ```sql
   SELECT type, COUNT(*) AS total_titles
   FROM netflix_titles
   GROUP BY type;
   ```

   * Counts total titles by type.
   * Helps understand the proportion of Movies vs TV Shows on Netflix.

2. **Top Countries with Most Content**

   ```sql
   SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS total
   FROM netflix_titles
   WHERE country IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY country
   ORDER BY total DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

   * Shows which countries produce the most Netflix content.

3. **Most Common Genres**

   ```sql
   SELECT listed_in AS genre, COUNT(*) AS total
   FROM netflix_titles
   GROUP BY genre
   ORDER BY total DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

   * Identifies the genres that dominate Netflix content.

4. **Content Release Trends**

   ```sql
   SELECT release_year, COUNT(*) AS total
   FROM netflix_titles
   GROUP BY release_year
   ORDER BY release_year DESC;
   ```

   * Tracks the number of titles released each year.

5. **Top Countries by Content (with ranking)**

   ```sql
   SELECT country,
          COUNT(*) AS total,
          RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
   FROM netflix_titles
   WHERE country IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY country;
   ```

   * Assigns a rank to countries based on the number of titles they produce.
