# 📺 Netflix Movies & TV Shows Analysis

## 🔹 Overview
This project analyzes the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset** available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows).  
The goal is to perform **SQL-based analysis** and generate insights into the distribution of content by type, country, release year, and genre.  

The analysis was done using **Databricks (PySpark + SQL)** and exported into Jupyter Notebook (`netflix.ipynb`) and Python script (`netflix.py`).
